### The League view

Split into its own file for the reason `client.md`'s closing map gives: the
division is by **the surface being described**, and this is one — the only page
in the app about the *fantasy league* rather than about players.
`components/LeagueView.tsx` draws it; **ESPN fantasy league**, *The league
scoreboard*, is where the reads behind it and their caching live.

**It is a fourth pill rather than an entry in the fantasy popover**, and both
halves of that were live options so the argument is worth stating.

The popover is where everything fantasy already lives — the roster-source
toggle, `Refresh from ESPN`, the doorway to the league's settings form — and
that is exactly what it holds: **controls over the app**. Which list the roster
views read, a cache bypass, a form. A scoreboard is none of those; it is a
**page of data** a manager comes back to through a week, and putting it behind
a popover would file the app's second-largest table under a menu whose other
three entries are switches.

The app's own test for what earns a pill is the one that collapsed Games into
the Feed: **a sort order is not a page, a different question is.** Roster and
Feed are the same players over the same days read two ways; Research is the
whole league over a season. This is a fourth question — *how is my team doing
against the league* — and it is the only view that holds a matchup at all.
Nothing in it is a re-reading of anything: no other page in the app knows the
league has weeks.

**It needs a league where Research needs no roster**, which is the one way it
parts from the pill beside it. Research is always present precisely because it
depends on nothing the reader has to have set up; this depends on a connected
ESPN league, and a pill leading to a page that could only ever say *connect a
league* is chrome for a feature the reader hasn't got. So `espnConnected` gates
it — in **either** roster mode, since the league's matchups are a fact about the
league rather than about which list the roster views happen to be reading.

**`view=league` is nonetheless read off the URL before that status has landed**,
and the view's own empty state says why if there turns out to be no league.
Silently dropping a link to Roster would leave somebody who was handed one with
nothing on screen to explain where it went, which is the direction this app
declines to fail in.

**What it costs the tab row, measured on the same page in one browser** by
drawing the bar with the pill and then again with it removed, at 320 / 375 / 390
/ 640 / 900 / 1200 / 1920. The view switch goes **216 → 289px** at every width.
The bar's own height is **unchanged on the Roster, Feed and League views at all
seven** (159 / 111 / 111 / 111 / 115 / 115 / 115), and moves on the **research**
view at two of them: **207 → 255px at 390** and **115 → 161 at 1920**, which is
one wrapped line each. That is the same 46–48px the three include buttons cost
1920 and that dropping `Qualified` won back, spent again — and it is spent on
the board alone, because that is the one page whose tab row already carries a
whole control set. **No horizontal overflow of the page body at any of the seven
widths on any of the four views.**

### What is on the page

Two blocks, in the order the two questions come in, and the second is why the
page is worth having twice: the scoreboard answers *am I winning*, the table
answers *why*.

**The scoreboard** is a card per matchup — `.lg-matchup`, the app's own panel
gradient on `--radius` — with both teams named, their logo and record beside
them, the headline number at the right end of each row, and the category line
under both. **The reader's own matchup leads**, which is a sort rather than a
mark and is what actually gets it on screen without scrolling on a phone; the
accent border and the `Your matchup` label are what say *which* one it is once
several are in view. Both were needed: on a 12-team league the board is ten
cards, so a mark alone would have been a mark you had to go and find.

**The winning side of each category is green and the losing side muted**, which
is deliberately *not* the `--hit`/`--strikeout` pair this app uses for a delta.
Red on the loser would put ten red cells on one side of every card — the whole
row shouting where the job is to mark a winner — so the app's rule that colour
is spent on **state** is honoured by marking one state and letting the other go
quiet. A tie is `--faint`, neither. Each cell's `title` spells it out in words
(`Runs: 32 — winning so far`), the `so far` appearing on a live period alone.

**A bye is a real shape, not a failed read.** The live 12-team league's first
playoff round is 2 matchups and **8 byes**, so a card with one team on it and
the word `Bye` is the ordinary case in mid-September rather than an error state.

**The period is navigable and its dates are printed.** `‹ Week 19 · Aug 10 –
Aug 14 · Live ›`, with the two arrows as the app's `--control-h` icon square.
The dates are not decoration and the `Live`/`Final` tag beside them is what
makes them readable: a **live** period's totals cover the days played *so far*
(ESPN's `pointsByScoringPeriod` truncates at its own current day), so the span
and the tag have to be read together or the numbers claim a whole week they have
not had. Measured on the live league: week 19 reads `Aug 10 – Aug 14 · Live`
against week 18's `Aug 3 – Aug 9 · Final`.

**The forward arrow is disabled on the week being played and stays that way**,
because ESPN materialises no future matchup period at all — there is nothing to
navigate to. Disabled rather than hidden: a control that comes and goes is
harder to aim at than one that dims, and its absence would say nothing about
why.

**`mp=` is in the URL only once the reader has navigated off the current
period.** Absent means *the one being played*, which is a **rule rather than a
value** — the same reasoning that keeps a date preset in the URL as its label
rather than as two dates, so a link shared this week opens on the week the
recipient is in rather than on a frozen one. Driven in a browser: the current
period writes no `mp`, `‹` writes `mp=18`, `‹` again `mp=17`, `›` back to
`mp=18`, and `?view=league&mp=14` opens on `Week 14 · Jun 29 – Jul 5 · Final`.

**The season table** is every team against every one of the league's own
categories, sortable per column, with the reader's own row on a 12% accent wash
— the same wash the pitcher card's live inning takes, enough to find your row
down a column of twelve and not enough to read as a selection you could act on.
The team cell carries the logo, the name, and the record, streak and (in a
points league) the points total on a second line.

**A logo is an arbitrary third-party URL and is treated as one.** ESPN lets a
manager upload anything: the live league carries images on `thespun.com` and
`pbs.twimg.com` beside ESPN's own CDN. `onError` swaps to the club's
abbreviation rather than leaving a broken-image glyph, which is the fallback
`TeamMark` already makes for an MLB cap that fails to load.

**A second small sort rather than the research board's, and that is the lesser
evil.** The board's sort is written against its `Column` vocabulary —
`value`, `toValue`, `ascFirst`, forty definitions of a derived rate — and none
of that exists here: these columns are **discovered at runtime** from the
league's own `scoringItems`, so there is no `Column` to reuse and nothing but a
comparison over `Record<number, number>`. What *is* reused is everything a
reader can see. `.league-table` is folded onto `.glog-table`'s selector lists
(one gutter clamp, one zebra stripe, one pinned first column, one set of
paddings) and onto the board's `.research-sort` / `.research-arrow` rules, which
is where the reserved arrow box, the accent-on-active header and the focus ring
come from — so a sorted header here is the same object as a sorted header on the
board, by construction rather than by care. Two of the board's own rules come
with it: **`ascFirst` per column**, so ERA and WHIP open on their good end
(checked: one press of `ERA` gives ▲ and `3.29 · 3.45 · 3.61` down from the top,
where `HR` gives ▼ and `232 · 223 · 221`), and **nulls to the bottom in both
directions**, a team with no figure not having a bad one.

### The four league formats, and the two it refuses to guess at

**The view is honest about the league it is looking at**, which took reading
`mSettings.scoringSettings.scoringType` rather than assuming head-to-head
categories:

- **`H2H_CATEGORY` / `H2H_MOST_CATEGORIES`** — matchups with a category line.
  This is what the live league is (`H2H_MOST_CATEGORIES`) and what everything
  above was measured on. The two share a bucket because the scoreboard is the
  same object either way: what differs is only how the league's *standings* are
  kept, and those are read off `mTeam` rather than computed.
- **`H2H_POINTS`** — matchups with one number a side. Drawn: the card's headline
  number becomes `totalPoints` and the category grid is not rendered at all,
  since there is none. **Unverified against a real league** — there was one
  league to test against and it is a category league — so this is the one part
  of the page a reviewer should be sceptical of.
- **`ROTO` / `TOTAL_POINTS`** — no matchups by design. The scoreboard half says
  so, naming ESPN's own word for the format, and the table stands alone, which
  in a roto league is the whole of what the league *is*.
- **Anything else** — named and refused: `This league's scoring isn't supported
  yet`, with `scoringType` printed. The table still draws, since `valuesByStat`
  is there whatever the format. A wrong scoreboard drawn confidently is the
  failure being avoided; a named refusal is one a reader can act on.

### Loading, and every state that has nothing to show

The app's own discipline, unchanged. **Never over data**: the previous board is
left standing while the next is in flight (`setScoreboard` is called on success
alone), so pressing `‹` does not blank the page. A **block wait** only when
there is nothing yet, behind `useDelayedFlag`'s `WAIT_DELAY` — the spinning
baseball over `Reading your league's scoreboard`, which names what is being
read the way every other wait in the app does.

**Each empty state names its own cause**, driven in a browser with the relevant
response stubbed:

| state | what it says |
| --- | --- |
| no league connected | `No fantasy league connected`, over a button that opens the league page |
| cookies expired (409 `espn-auth`) | `Couldn't read your league` over ESPN's own message — *the espn_s2 cookie expires — sign in to ESPN again and re-copy it* |
| roto / total points | `No matchups in this league`, naming `scoringType` |
| a scoring type this page has not been read against | `This league's scoring isn't supported yet`, naming `scoringType` |
| a period ESPN has no schedule for | `No matchups in week N` |
| no teams at all | `No teams in this league` — usually a league id for another season |

**The 409 is handled rather than swallowed**, which is what the route's
`code: 'espn-auth'` is for: `api.ts` treats a 401 as an expired *Cognito* token
and retries it, so a credential problem answered as 401 would be a silent retry
loop. Measured with the scoreboard route stubbed to 409: the page draws
`Couldn't read your league` with ESPN's sentence under it, and the League pill,
the other three views and the page's own chrome are all untouched.

### What it draws and what it deliberately does not

The League page is neither a roster reading nor the board, so it carries **no
kind tabs, no date control, no `Starters` toggle** and none of the report's own
waits or empty states. Every one of those was gated on `view !== 'research'` —
right while Research was the only page that is not a roster reading, and the
League view is the second — so the nine render sites now read
`isRosterView(view)`, a named test over `summary | feed`. **The three *effects*
that carried the same string were left naming the board**, which is what they
always meant: the ownership read the board depends on, the statuses map it
draws, and the board's own fetch. Measured: on the League view `kind-switch`,
`date-toggle` and `starters-toggle` are each **0**, and on Roster and Feed each
is **1**, unchanged.

**The scroll offset keys on the view alone** (`'league'`), exactly as the
research board's does, because this page has no kind: it is one board about one
league.

### Measured

Driven against the built client and the live 2026 league at **390×844 and
1200×900**:

- **Page-body overflow 0** at both, and at 320 / 375 / 640 / 900 / 1920 as well,
  on all four views. (One real overflow was found and fixed on the way: at 320
  the `Bye` card's name carried `flex: none` beside `white-space: nowrap`, so a
  long team name pushed the `Bye` tag **3px past the edge of the page**. The
  name is elastic like every other row's now, `margin-left: auto` on the tag
  being what puts it at the right end.)
- **Week 19 · Aug 10 – Aug 14 · Live**, 10 matchups of which **8 are byes**, the
  reader's own first and the only one carrying `.lg-mine`.
- The category head reads `R · HR · RBI · W · ERA · SB · WHIP · K · OPS · SVHD`
  — the league's own ten, in the league's own order — and the two real matchups
  carry **17 wins, 17 losses and 6 ties** across the 40 cells they have between
  them.
- The table draws **12 rows** with **1** on the accent wash, its header the same
  ten categories, the pane bleeding to **0 from both edges** at 390 (`paneW`
  390, `paneL` 0) with the table itself 739px inside it.
- The card column is **346px at 390**, which is the app's own gutters.
